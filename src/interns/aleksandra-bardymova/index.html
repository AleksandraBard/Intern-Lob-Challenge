          Hey, I am Sasha! I have graduated from Grace Hopper Program at
          Fullstack Academy in New York. I always wanted to find a job where I
          would constantly learn new things. After I tried coding I realized
          that it is definitely that what I want to do. Here you can constantly
          learn, develop yourself, sharp your skills, make your impact and see
          the results. I love learning, love challenges, appreciate
          technologies, and IT has all that elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a beginner in the new field for me I am excited to start my career
          in the internship program. It is a great chance for me to work with
          experienced engineers, explore new technologies and implement those
          pieces of knowledge for solving real-world problems. I would like to
          dive more into the backend stack, become fluent in server-side
          languages as Python, Java, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main criteria for the product which I want to work on are its use,
          knowing that it can be efficiently used in the industry and will make
          a significant positive impact on technology progress and even people's
          lives.
